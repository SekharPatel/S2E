# S2E Playbook System Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive database-driven Playbook system for the S2E security testing application. The system replaces the static `playbooks.json` file with dynamic database models, enabling users to create custom playbooks and link them to specific projects.

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Database and Backend Foundation ✅

#### 1.1 New Database Models Created
- **`Playbook` Model**: Stores playbook metadata and trigger configuration
  - Fields: `id`, `name`, `description`, `created_at`, `trigger_name`, `trigger_tool_id`, `trigger_options`, `user_id`
  - Includes `to_dict()` method for JSON compatibility

- **`PlaybookRule` Model**: Stores individual rules within playbooks
  - Fields: `id`, `on_service` (JSON), `action_name`, `action_tool_id`, `action_options`, `playbook_id`
  - Helper methods: `get_on_service_list()`, `set_on_service_list()`, `to_dict()`

- **`project_playbooks` Association Table**: Many-to-many relationship between projects and playbooks

#### 1.2 Database Migration
- Created and applied migration: "Add Playbook and PlaybookRule models with project-playbook many-to-many relationship"
- All tables created successfully in SQLite database

#### 1.3 Seeder Command
- Implemented `flask seed-playbooks` CLI command
- Migrates existing playbooks from `playbooks.json` to database
- Creates system user if none exists
- Successfully seeded 3 playbooks with 19 total rules

### Phase 2: Project Creation and Linking ✅

#### 2.1 Updated Project Creation API (`POST /api/projects`)
- Added support for `playbook_ids` parameter (array of integers)
- Validates playbook IDs and links them to the new project
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### 2.2 Updated Project Edit API (`POST /api/projects/<id>/edit`)
- Added playbook linking support
- Clears existing links and applies new ones
- Handles validation and error cases

#### 2.3 Updated Project Details API (`GET /api/projects/<id>`)
- Returns `playbook_ids` array with linked playbook IDs
- Used for populating edit forms

#### 2.4 Updated Home Route (`/home`)
- `all_playbooks`: All available playbooks for creation/edit modals
- `linked_playbooks`: Only playbooks linked to active project for dashboard display
- Removed dependency on `playbooks.json`

#### 2.5 Updated HTML Templates
- **Dashboard**: Shows only linked playbooks with improved messaging
- **Project Creation Modal**: Added multi-select dropdown for playbook linking
- **Project Edit Modal**: Added playbook selection with current selections pre-populated

#### 2.6 Updated JavaScript (`home.js`)
- Handles multiple select values for playbook IDs
- Converts selected options to integer array for API calls
- Populates edit form with currently linked playbooks

### Phase 3: Playbook Engine Refactoring ✅

#### 3.1 Rewritten `handle_playbook()` Function
- **Database Integration**: Queries `Playbook` and `PlaybookRule` models instead of JSON
- **ID Validation**: Now expects integer database IDs instead of string IDs
- **Trigger Execution**: Uses `playbook.trigger_tool_id` and `playbook.trigger_options`
- **Rule Processing**: Iterates through `playbook.rules.all()` and uses model fields
- **Action Execution**: Uses `rule.action_tool_id`, `rule.action_name`, `rule.action_options`
- **Service Matching**: Uses `rule.get_on_service_list()` for service filtering

### Phase 4: Full Playbook Management UI ✅

#### 4.1 New Playbooks Blueprint
- Created `app/playbooks/routes.py` with comprehensive CRUD operations
- Registered blueprint in Flask application

#### 4.2 Route Implementation
- **`GET /playbooks`**: List all playbooks with management options
- **`GET /playbooks/new`**: Form to create a new playbook  
- **`POST /playbooks/new`**: Handle playbook creation with dynamic rules
- **`GET /playbooks/<id>/edit`**: Form to edit existing playbook
- **`POST /playbooks/<id>/edit`**: Handle playbook updates
- **`POST /playbooks/<id>/delete`**: Delete playbook (with safety checks)
- **`POST /playbooks/<id>/clone`**: Clone existing playbook for customization
- **`GET /api/playbooks/<id>/export`**: Export playbook as JSON

#### 4.3 Advanced Features
- **Playbook Cloning**: Copy system playbooks to create custom versions
- **Export/Import**: JSON export functionality for backup/sharing
- **Project Linking Validation**: Prevents deletion of linked playbooks
- **Dynamic Rule Management**: Add/remove rules with live UI updates

#### 4.4 User Interface Components
- **List View**: Card-based layout showing playbook details, rules count, linked projects
- **Create/Edit Forms**: Dynamic forms with add/remove rule functionality
- **Flash Messages**: Success/error feedback system
- **Navigation Integration**: Added Playbooks link to sidebar

#### 4.5 Template System
- **`templates/playbooks/list.html`**: Comprehensive playbook listing
- **`templates/playbooks/new.html`**: Dynamic playbook creation form
- **`templates/playbooks/edit.html`**: Pre-populated edit form with existing data
- **Enhanced `base.html`**: Flash message support and playbook navigation
